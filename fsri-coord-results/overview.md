# Suppression Methods

## Method #1
Second floor bedroom with fire from two windows. Suppression will be conducted via an interior attack up the stairs. Ventilation is to occur after the fire is considered under control.
 - Front door open on conditions
 - Suppression crew enters and proceeds to top of stairs.
 - 'Wall Ceiling Wall' method of suppression towards to approach bedroom fire using 150gpm straight stream.
 - Once at bedroom, steep angle off ceiling, followed by entry for surface suppression. 
 - Check for exterior extension
 -  Preform Ventilation Type (None, Hydraulic, Vertical, Serious (All 2nd Floor Window), Positive Pressure)

## Method #2
Second floor bedroom with fire from two windows. Suppression will be conducted via an interior attack up the stairs. Ventilation is to occur during or just proior to suppression operations.
 - Front Door open On Conditions
 - Suppression crew enters and proceeds to bottom of stairs.
 - Preform Ventilation Type (Vertical Over Fire, Vertical Over Stairs, Positive Pressure)
 - 'Wall Ceiling Wall' method of suppression towards to approach bedroom fire using 150gpm straight stream.
 - Once at bedroom, steep angle off ceiling, followed by entry for surface suppression. 
 - Check for exterior extension

## Method #3
Second floor bedroom with fire from two windows. Suppression will be conducted via a transitional attack. Ventilation is to occur at transitional attack.
 - Transitional hit on conditions.
 - Front door open.
 - Preform Ventilation Type (None, Serious, Positive Pressure).
 - Suppression crew advances directly to compartment.
 - Once at bedroom, steep angle off ceiling, followed by entry for surface suppression. 
 - Check for exterior extension.

## Method #4
Second floor bedroom with fire from two windows where the ceiling to the fire room has failed. Suppression will be conducted via a transitional attack. Ventilation is to occur at transitional attack.
 - Transitional hit on conditions [Method #4a will involve shutting down the line before to simulate a transition hit for less than ideal time.]
 - Preform ventilation type (additional horizontal on 2nd floor).
 - Front door open, crew advances directly to compartment.
 - Once at bedroom, steep angle off ceiling, followed by entry for surface suppression. 
 - Check for exterior extension.

## Method #5
Kitchen Fire with fire from two windows. Suppression will be conducted via an interior attack. Ventilation is to 1 minutes after suppression crew enters.
 - Front door open on conditions.
 - Door read (5 seconds).
 - Perform ventilation type (vertical over stairway, horizontal, horizontal w/PPV). [For vertical vent shall be completed 1 minute after crew enters.]
 - Suppression crew enters, 'Wall Ceiling Wall' method of suppression towards to approach kitchen fire using 150gpm straight stream.

## Method #6
Kitchen Fire with fire from two windows. Suppression will be conducted via an transitional attack. 
 - Transitional hit on conditions.
 - Front door open.
 - Preform Ventilation Type (None, Serious, Horizontal w/PPV).
 - Suppression crew advances directly to compartment.
 - Once at kitchen, steep angle off ceiling, followed by entry for surface suppression.
