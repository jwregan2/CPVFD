Experiments studied both interior and exterior attack combined with different ventilation types (horizontal and positive pressure). The structures were instrumented to quantify the hazard to potential vicitms and firefighters.</div>

                    <p>The UL Firefighter Safety Research Institute (FSRI) is leading a 3-year Technology and Product Development Project examining coordinated fire attack utilizing acquired structures. The increased understanding of fire behavior that has emerged from previous AFG funded research has raised many questions that revolve around what constitutes a coordinated fire attack and how to effectively accomplish it in different types of structures.</p>
