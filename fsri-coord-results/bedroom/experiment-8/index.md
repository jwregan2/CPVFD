Experiment 8 was intended to evaluate the effectiveness of vertical ventilation remote from the fire compartment just prior to the suppression crew ascending the stairs on a second floor bedroom fire. The fire was ignited in the upholstered chair next to the bed and permitted to grow until it reached flashover and fire was venting from both open windows in the room. Suppression was conducted via an interior attack up the stairs. Ventilation was coordinated with entry to the structure.
